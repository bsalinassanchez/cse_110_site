## Introduction

Hello, my name is Brandon Salinas Sanchez and I am a 2nd year CS major at UCSD. This quarter I look forward to learning a lot from the professor and working together with my classmates!

In this page you will find out who I am as a [programmer](#Programming-History) and as a [person](#Personal).

## Programming History

My programming history is not all that intersting. I first learned how to code in Java in high school for robotics and for AP CSA. The rest I have learned through course work at UCSD or self learned!

I ~~am still learning~~ have written some **_pretty crazy_** programs before, for example:

`print('Hello, World!)`

> Insane yes I know

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(void)
{
    cout << "Hello, World!" << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

> ðŸ˜±

```Java
class MyClass {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

> ðŸ˜´

Anyways, I hope to keep learning more about Software Engineering in this course!

## Personal

Outside of programming and course work/school I like to think I am a very chill person.

One of my passtimes and something I like doing with friends is hanging out and exploring new places. San Diego has a lot to offer when it comes to sights, food, and shops.

I also love listening to different kinds of music. Some of my favorites recently include:

- New N3on - Playboi Carti
- Left Right - XG
- Trance - Metro Boomin & Travis Scott

I also playing video games such as Valorant, Overwatch, and recently CS

Other than that I have personal goals from here on out until next fall. Some of them include

- [ ] fixing my sleep schedule
- [ ] drinking more water
- [ ] being more active
- [ ] managing my time better

Overall, I hope to learn several things in this course

1. How to develop a project
2. How to work and communicate with a group to accomplish a task
3. Have fun!
